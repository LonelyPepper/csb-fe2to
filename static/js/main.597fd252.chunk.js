OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!\n\nAnd when we woke up, we had these bodies. Throw her in the brig. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! No, just a regular mistake. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.\nYou guys realize you live in a sewer, right?\n\nMaybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!\n\n    Meh.\n    That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!\n    Leela's gonna kill me.\n\nYou can see how I lived before I met you.\n\nDaddy Bender, we're hungry. Guess again. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?\n\n    Oh yeah, good luck with that.\n    What are their names?\n    I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.\n\nNo! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Why yes! Thanks for noticing.\n\nI barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.\n\nWith gusto. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.\n\nA sexy mistake. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?\n\nOh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be\u2026\n\nShut up and take my money! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Belligerent and numerous.\n\nWe need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.\n\nSoon enough. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.\n\nWith a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.\n\nThen throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as \"the brig\". Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Bender, quit destroying the universe!\n\nWe're also Santa Claus! Kids have names? Now what?
